A basic voice Assistant

You can use this for non commercial use.
If you have quistions or if you like to have a tutorial you can write on my Discord Server : https://discord.gg/Bjbe5Cb.
I made two steps so far so stay tune. If I change something I'll write it on my Discord server. You can find the new Steps with pressing strg+f and than type in new. Don't hate me if I make something wrong. This is my first Python project.

1. In the first step we basicly going to make a simple text to speech. That means that something you say the voice helper say it back.(Check out https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-convert-speech-to-text-and-text-to-speech/ this Article helped me alout and is the first step)

2. In the second step we will change the error message and that the voice helper will answer after you say a specific word. You can imagen that it's like Hey Google or Hey Siri, but we are far away.

3. In this step I'd like to add Wikipedia to the project so you can basicly ask : 'spirit wikipedia ... ' or 'spirit search'. You can also add an option that when you say 'mount' it give you options to choose a summary. But that is something I maybe add laters
