A basic voice Assistant

You can use this for non commercial use.
If you have quistions or if you like to have a tutorial you can write on my Discord Server : https://discord.gg/Bjbe5Cb.
I made two steps so far so stay tune. If I change something I'll write it on my Discord server. You can find the new Steps with pressing strg+f and than type in new. Don't hate me if I make something wrong. This is my first Python project and I'm not very good in english.

1. In the first step we basicly going to make a simple text to speech. That means that something you say the voice helper say it back.(Check out https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-convert-speech-to-text-and-text-to-speech/ this Article helped me alout and is the first step)

2. In the second step we will change the error message and that the voice helper will answer after you say a specific word. You can imagen that it's like Hey Google or Hey Siri, but we are far away.

3. In this step I'd like to add a Notification, when you get a Mail.

4. In the next step I want to add a little screen, wich make it look a little bit better.

If you want to have a advanced tutorial for more things to add, like wikipedia or weather than write me on my Discord and I'll make a tutorial as fast as possible.
